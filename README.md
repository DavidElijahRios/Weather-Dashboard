## Description

I wanted to get a better understanding of how to call API's and be able to use that accessed data to use in a website, as well as get familiarized with this ability due to many websites using API's for better functionality. It helps gather data from already provided servers that can be accessed rather than having to create that information yourself. I see that API's are very powerful and extremly useful for dynamic websites.
